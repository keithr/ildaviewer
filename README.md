This is a personal project. The goal is to write a tool that can create rotoscoped ilda files for laser shows 
without having to pay a too much for software that doesn't work very well. 

This is currently a .net core 6 app (created using the VS 2022 preview version). It's currently a Winform App. But the UI code is minimal. 
The goal is to move this to MAUI at some point. 

The IDLA files included in this repository are licenced by their owners. They are from multiple free idla sites and I do not represent them as my own. 
The documentation files are from the standards body that works with laser manufacturers. I don't represent those files as my own.

The code has an MIT licenses (until I need to use code with a more restrictive license - then I will move to that license).

We have a long way to go.
