# ildaviewer
ildaviewer project

This is a personal project. The goal is to write a tool that can create rotoscoped ilda files for laser shows 
without having to pay a too much for software that doesn't work very well. 

This is currently a .net core 6 app (created using the VS 2022 preview version). It's currently a Winform App. But the UI code is minimal. 
The goal is to move this to MAUI at some point. 

We have a long way to go.
